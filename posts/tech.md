# How I got into tech as a teacher and why you should too

---

Second blog post - I'm writing this one during my all day professional development day for my tech cohort. I thought I would explain why I'm so into tech integration in my classroom. It's simple really, I hate paper. I really really really hate it. Especially because I am on a cart. Yep. All the teachers reading this just went "aww..." For those not in the know, this means that I don't have a classroom. I push in to other classrooms during other teachers' planning periods. I've come to terms with this and I actually kind of like the cart now. But paper + mobile cart = not a good combination. I have to be even more organized than someone with a classroom because it is much easier for me to lose things. Last year, when I was first figuring out how to make the cart work, I realized that tech could be the key to me not going crazy. And I was right! During the week before school I planned out how I could cut down paper as much as humanly possible. For me, this meant using [Nearpod](https://nearpod.com/?utm_expid=.hkxGlpQrTmqMbhkgVj4mMg.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) religiously (I'll definitely make a post all about Nearpod soon), as well as [ActivelyLearn](https://www.activelylearn.com/) and [Edpuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com/).

## Tech cohorts galore

I'll admit it - I'm addicted to tech cohorts. Obviously in my relentless pursuit of a paperless classroom (cart?) I needed help. Thankfully, my school has a thriving support system for tech integration in the form of Technology Integration Specialists who run frequent professional development sessions and longer tech cohorts to go over tons of cool tools one could use while teaching. I think I've signed up for every possible tech cohort since I've been here. I love learning about new ways to bring tech into my classroom and I can't recommend them enough. The TLP Portfolio page that you can navigate to at the top of this site is the culmination of the most advanced tech cohort that my district offers (not that I'm bragging or anything). During the next tech cohort, I'll actually get the chance to help other teachers learn to use Actively Learn - a tool that I introduced to the TIS's (I'm just a little proud).

## Going overboard

So why am I learning to code as a busy teacher who is already tech savvy enough to successfully implement tech integration in my classroom? Because I'm a nerd, that's why. I want to understand and appreciate all that goes in to educational technology. Plus, I'm finding it super rewarding to say that I truly created this website myself (with some help from Propolis). My colleagues are using Weebly for their portfolio websites and their's will certainly look much more creative and interactive than mine, but I'm dedicated to doing this the hard way. Maybe I'll also create a Weebly page since the district is paying for premium sites for us (!!!), who knows? If you're a teacher, I highly recommend that you create some sort of digital portfolio (coded yourself or otherwise). It's a great way to showcase your work, especially during a modern job search.

## Next steps

Moving forward, I'll continue to work on this site as well as my lesson plans for Psychology. I've already got the skeleton of the first unit done, including the podcasting elements!
