# Coding so far & some project meetings

---

First blog post! Hello world! Alright so, today I want to talk about how I'm approaching coding for the first time in my life and document the beginning of my TLP project - since I had two pretty successful meetings today.

## How I'm learning to code

I had never coded before last year. I started with [codeacademy's](https://codeacademy.com) intro to HTML sometime in November 2019, but as a teacher, life got kind of busy. Thankfully, winter break was extra long this year which gave me time to not only finish that course, but also to decide that learning to code was something that I really wanted to dive in to for my own personal and professional development. The blog you're currently on is how I am utilizing what I'm still learning on Code Academy - I finished their intro to CSS course yesterday and just started the JavaScript course (gotta love maintaining a streak). I love coming home and focusing on my own learning after a full day of prioritizing everyone else. I'll periodically update this blog as to what I'm using and what my next steps are!

## My TLP Project

As a member of the Teacher Leadership Project, I am required to showcase my advanced knowledge of tech integration through a documented implementation of tech in my own classroom. I've decided to make the focus of my project _podcasting_. In my on-level semester-long Psychology class, I am going to design a Project-based course in which my students will use podcasting to show their learning. I had a meeting with the lead Technology Integration Specialist (TIS) at my school to go over my idea and she is totally on board and has already helped me make this a reality. I also met with my administrator - who is a big fan of project-based learning - to go over those aspects of the class and she was also so helpful.

## What is Project-Based Learning?

When you were in school, you probably had several classes where your teacher used projects as **assessments** - meaning that she or he would teach the class in a typical way and then at the end of a unit instead of measuring your learning using a traditional exam, they would give you a project grade. Projects are a great way to assess students. While they take longer to plan, scaffold (build up to), and grade, they typically give you a more accurate image of what your students know.

Project-based learning is a bit different. In PBL the project _is_ the learning. You start with a question and as your students work to answer that question, they learn. The key to PBL is that students end up with a product, which is why I picked podcasting. I think that creating their own podcast will empower students to take control of their own learning, increase their engagement, and improve their retention of the content.

Here are some studies on Project-Based Learning:

- [Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning](https://doi.org/10.1080/00461520.1991.9653139)
- [Project-Based Learning for the 21st Century: Skills for the Future](https://doi.org/10.1080/00098650903505415)
- [Doing With Understanding: Lessons From Research on Problem- and Project-Based Learning](https://doi.org/10.1080/10508406.1998.9672056)

Now that I think about it, this website is my own project that I'm basing my learning around when it comes to coding!

Next post will probably be after my next TLP meeting - hopefully I'll have some more concrete plans for Psychology.
