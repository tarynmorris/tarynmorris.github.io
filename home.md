> Welcome to my blog! I am a second year Social Studies teacher at T.C. Williams High School and I love EdTech. I am committed to teaching the past with relevancy to the future. This year, I was accepted into the Teacher Leadership Program - a program dedicated to inspiring teachers to expand their horizons using unique EdTech tools - and this blog is the culmination of all of my learning and teaching.
