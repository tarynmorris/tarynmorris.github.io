Welcome to my blog! I am a second year Social Studies teacher at T.C. Williams High School and I love EdTech. I am committed to teaching the past with relevancy to the future. This year, I was accepted into the Teacher Leadership Program - a program dedicated to inspiring teachers to expand their horizons using unique EdTech tools - and this blog is the culmination of all of my learning and teaching.

In addition to TLP, I have also challenged myself to dive further in to technology by learning the basics of coding and blog building. The blog you are currently on was built using the web application [Propolis](https://tirey.me/#/)
